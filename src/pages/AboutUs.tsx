      <h2>About Taniti</h2>
      <p>
        Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has
        an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and
        includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
        tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small,
        active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000.
        Until a recent increase in tourism, most of the Tanitian economy was
        dominated by fishing or agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our island is a paradise of natural beauty and cultural richness. We
        invite you to explore our vibrant rainforests, pristine beaches, and
        unique attractions, all while experiencing the warmth and hospitality of
        the Tanitian people.
